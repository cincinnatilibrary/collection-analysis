        "1. Data related to holds when the hold status is changed to, \"ready for pickup\" is recorded on a automatic, and regular basis, and captures data that Sierra would ordinarily remove from the system around the hold--hold id, hold placed, associated bib and item, patron, location, time, etc (Sierra removes this data from the system when holds are no longer relevant--e.g. when the associated patron account fills the hold by checking out the item.)\n",
        "1. Data related to circulation activity. This data is use to pair the associated item and patron data from the hold data, and is used to determine if the patron record had a \"filled hold\" transaction for the specific item related to the hold.\n",
        "\n",
        "To identify HA/HT titles and bulk-holds the search involves looking for the following attributes related to holds:\n",
        "1. A large number of holds are placed for a title on a single date\n",
        "1. The date of the hold identified above, is a date _before_ the cataloging date\n",
        "\n",
        "To identify if a patron had filled that hold involves looking at circulation transaction data in relationship with the above HA/HT hold data:\n",
        "1. item and patron record associated with the hold data above also have an associated \"filled hold\" transaction--indicating that the item has been checked out \n",
